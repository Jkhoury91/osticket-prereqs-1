Then, I chose the resource group I created, set up a VM name, selected a region and Image (whether windows or ubuntu), and selected the size for to set up the amount of Vcpu's that I will need to successfully deploy the VM.

After configuration of IIS is complete, I installed the OSticketing system. Once the install was complete I went back to IIS to enable some extensions and refresh the OSticket site to observe the changes. Then I continued completing the last few set up requirments in order to start creating an admin user multiple end users who can submit tickets.
